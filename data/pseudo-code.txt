OK, let's figure out what we need to do:

When the page loads:
- Display start screen (type your name)
- Capture the new user id
- Create a users object

Building the quiz from the database (server side):
- Go through the array of questions and grab all the names ("answers")
- Check for duplicates, toss them out
- Create an array of all the answers

When someone types in their name and presses the button:
- Add the name to the user id
- Add them to the users object
- Set their score to zero
- Trigger the start of the game (request question 1)

When question requested

- Grab a random question
- Grab the answer
- Grab 4 other answers from the random array (while excluding the actual answer)
- Shuffle the 5 answers
- Send Q + 5as over to Client

(Client) When Q+5As received:
